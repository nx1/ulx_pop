NOTES
=====
Changing the accretion efficiency has actually resulted in my populations
for ULX, beamed ULX etc Changing, therefore old ids are no longer valid and
I have chosen to change them to the absolute ids assigned at the start if something
like this were to happen again.


1. The MC alive/dead/plot and simulations are only run on:
    ULX systems \w \theta / 2 < 45.
    I need to make this clearer in the paper.

2. What percentage of the TOTAL ULX population is either Alive/Dead/Transient as a function of dincl?

    141 are potentially alive/dead/transient for which we calculate MC distributions.
    the remaining are always alive.

NOTES
=====
Changing the accretion efficiency has actually resulted in my populations
for ULX, beamed ULX etc Changing, therefore old ids are no longer valid and
I have chosen to change them to the absolute ids assigned at the start if something
like this were to happen again.

I have also thought that the previous quantity that we were calculation
known as 'ratio', i.e. The measure of how transient a paticular system is
actually not paticularly of use.
    1. Previously calculating this value basically showed that the distribution of transient systems
    just seemed to be 'guassian' on ratio=0.5, i.e the majority of transient systems were on 50% of the time.
    So far the quantity is useful for creating a pretty plot showing the effect of dincl on the transient population
    however the same effect is much better illustrated by showing the relative number of alive/dead/transient systems
    against dincl.

What i want to save from the lightcurves?
1. classification | alive/dead/transient
2. Simulation information
    The changing quantities for ULXLC are:
        theta - dincl - inclination

Since a lot of the curves will likely have the same theta, (maximally beamed saturation)
I can probably avoid a lot of repeated calculations for these systems.





1. The MC alive/dead/plot and simulations are only run on:
    ULX systems \w \theta / 2 < 45.
    I need to make this clearer in the paper.

2. What percentage of the TOTAL ULX population is either Alive/Dead/Transient as a function of dincl?

    141 are potentially alive/dead/transient for which we calculate MC distributions.
    the remaining are always alive.

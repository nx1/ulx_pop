    - 1035 - Explaination - Mention that the XLFs are time-averaged

    - 1144 - Explaination - Expand, again talk about time-averaged vs snapshot
    
- The ULX population is likely to be a different mix of metallicities.
- Greg (2019) used a toy model of the milky way where he used 50:50 ratio of two differnt metallicities

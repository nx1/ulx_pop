
For each system, we provided to ULXLC the following parameters:
	$\theta / 2$, $i$, $\Delta i$, $L_{x}$, $P$, $\phi$, $\Beta = 0.3$
	$i$, $\Delta i$ and $\phi$ are sampled from uniform distributions with the following minimums and maxima:
	$0^\circ \le \Delta i \le \Delta i_{\mathrm{max}}$
	$0^\circ \le  i \le 90^\circ$
	$0 \le  \phi \le 1.0$
	
	
Lightcurves were then generated with 5000 data points, a timestep of 0.01, and a default period of 50, as to create a single
cycle/pulse of the lightcurve. For each system, two curves are generated, one at $i=0$ which is scaled so that the maximum of the
lighcurve was equal to $L_{x}$, and one at abitrary (input) inclination which is scaled by the same factor the 0 inclination curve.

Systems with $theta / 2 > 45^{\circ}$ were classified as being alive without needing to simulate lightcurves, while systems
identified as being transient were subjected to further analysis.










\results section

One observational quantity of interest is the percentage of \textit{transient} to observed sources (i.e $\perctransobs$), this quantity appears to be relatively
independent by our duty cycle parameter $d$, and if we use our largest prior for the maximum precessional angle $\Delta i_{\rm max} = 45^{\circ}$,
we find that adjusting our black hole ratio results in distinct 1-sigma error regions by cycle eight for both precession mechanisms
(see figure \ref{fig:trans_alive_p_wind_45} & \ref{fig:trans_alive_p_sup_45}).

 Table
\ref{tab:erass_identified_transients} indicates the percentage of objects
correctly identified as being transient by \erass \ at the end of the 8 cycles $( \sum_{c=1}^{8}N^{\rm trans}_c )$. We observe that using the relation for $P_{\mathrm{wind}}$, only around $\sim
15-25\%$ of the transient population was identified, while using the relation
for $P_{\mathrm{sup}}$ we see around $\sim 65\%$ of transient sources were identified (noting that this value does not appear to change
substantially with
$\%_{\mathrm{BH}}$.) The full table of results is provided in the additional content.

\noindent From Figure \ref{fig:classification_i_dincl}, we observe that, for our
subset of beamed ($\theta / 2 \le 45^{\circ}$) sources, there are no
\textit{alive} systems at inclinations above $79^{\circ}$ while no
\textit{dead} systems are found below inclinations of $28^{\circ}$.
Conversely, \textit{transient} systems are found across the entire range of
inclinations and precessional angles (excluding $\Delta i = 0^{\circ}$),
however are more likely to be found at mid-inclinations $(i \sim 45^{\circ}$)
and with large precessional angles ($\Delta i \sim 45^{\circ}$), as expected. 





\subsection{Comparison to observations} 

%As we have established in the previous sections, beaming combined with
%precession is expected to be observationally different in NS and BHs.
%Observationally, it is only possible to obtain numerical constraints on the
%number of alive and transient systems as classified in section
%\ref{sec:MC_method}. In this section we aim to evaluate %if the relative ratio
%of alive to transient systems may serve as an indicator of the underlying
%population demographic.

%with $N_{H}=2.4 \times 10^{21} \ cm^{-2}$  and $\Gamma=2.2$, as determined from

We performed simulations spanning 
$\%_{\mathrm {BH}}$ from 0\% (all NSs) to 100\% (all BHs) in steps of 25\%
while also varying the metallicity of our parent population (Z = 0.02, \ 0.002
and \ 0.0002) and investigated duty cycles $d=0.1, \ 0.2, \ 0.3$ and $1.0$, finally
we investigated the effect of different maximum precessional angles of $\Delta
i_{\mathrm{max}}=20^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$. We use the same sampling prescription outlined
in section \ref{sec:MC_method} throughout the remainder of this work.
Figure \ref{fig:ADT} shows one such set of results for $\Delta i_{\mathrm{max}} = 20^{\circ}$, $Z = 0.002$, $d=0.2$ and for a range of black hole population percentages.

		\section{Summary and conclusions} 
		%-----------------------------------------------------------
	

		We computed various statistical characteristics of the expected eRASS AGN sample, including their luminosity- and redshift distributions, and the magnitude distributions of their optical counterparts.
	
		The eROSITA all-sky survey will produce an unprecedented sample of about $3$~million X-ray selected AGN.
		With a median redshift of $z\approx1$, approximately $40\,\%$ of the eRASS objects will be located between redshifts $z=1$ and $z=2$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:N_z}).
		We predict that about $10^4-10^5$ AGN beyond redshift $z=3$ and about $2\,000-30\,000$ AGN beyond redshift $z=4$, the exact numbers depending on the behavior of the AGN XLF in the high-redshift and high-luminosity regimes (Fig.~\ref{fig:N_Lz}).
		
		The eRASS AGN sample will open the possibility of studying the growth of supermassive black holes, their co-evolution with host galaxies and dark matter halos, and their relation to the large-scale structure to unprecedented detail, and potentially, it may also help to constrain cosmological parameters \citep{Kolodzig2013,Huetsi2013}.
		Importantly, it will permit one to conduct these studies beyond redshift $z=1$, which is poorly covered by the current optical surveys.
		
		To fully exploit this potential of eRASS, an extensive optical support will be critical.
		One of the main goals of optical follow-up will be to provide redshifts for eRASS AGN, but its importance will reach far beyond this, including, for example,  studies of the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies
		(see \citealp{Kolodzig2013} for a discussion of the different goals of optical follow-ups and their requirements and prospects).
		With the capabilities of the currently available facilities and their time allocation strategies, measuring of optical  spectra for the entire sample of the $\sim3$~million objects does not appear to be achievable on realistic timescales.
		However upcoming hardware and survey programs and proposals, for instance, 4MOST \citep{deJong2012} and WEAVE \citep{WEAVE}, can make this task more realistic, especially for some limited areas of sky.
		Furthermore, introducing mutliband photometry and other improvements of the photometric redshift measurement techniques will make determining of photometric redshifts  for large samples of eRASS AGN possible \citep{Salvato2011,Saglia2012}.

		\subsection{Luminosity distribution} \label{ssec:LumDis}
		%''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
		
		Luminosity distributions of detected AGN are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:N_L}.
		In the soft band they peak at $\sim10^{44}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$, with only a small difference between the extragalactic sky sample ($\approx10^{44.0}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$) and the ecliptic poles ($\approx10^{43.8}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$).
		The peak in the hard band occurs at $\approx10^{44.4}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$.
		The median values differ by less than $1\,\%$ from the corresponding peak values.
		Comparing these with the values of $L_\ast$ from the Table~\ref{tab:LDDE_BestFit},
		the location of the peak is defined by the $L_\ast$ luminosity and does not strongly depend on the survey sensitivity.
		A change of the latter by two orders of magnitude changes the position of the peak only by $\sim0.5\;\mathrm{dex}$. %($10^{-15} - 10^{-13}\;\mathrm{erg\;s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$)
		Hence, our predictions for the luminosity distribution are very robust against moderate changes of the survey sensitivity.
		From the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:N_L} one can see that the luminosity distribution in the soft band changes only marginally at high luminosity ($\ga10^{44}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$) if we exclude the high-redshift cutoff of the XLF.
		
		From the cumulative luminosity distributions of the extragalactic sky (right panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:N_L}) about $10\,\%$ (vertical dashed lines) of the detected AGN will have luminosities higher than $\sim10^{45}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$.
		This large  sample of luminous AGN ($\sim3\times10^5$ in full redshift range) will improve the constraints on the high-luminosity end of the XLF.
		For comparison, the AGN sample of H05 had about $\sim100$ AGN with a luminosity higher than $\sim10^{45}\mathrm{\,erg\;s^{-1}}$.
		
		In the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:N_fb} the luminosity distribution of the brightest $10\,\%$ (those with the highest flux, blue curve) and the faintest $10\,\%$ (lowest flux, red) do not differ much from each other and from the distribution of the total sample (black).
		We note that the luminosity distribution of objects detected in the half-year survey is well represented by that of the brightest $10\,\%$ of the sources.

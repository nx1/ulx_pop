ULX Population Study
====================

This repo contains auxilary files for the paper entitled The effect of Lense-Thirring
on the observed population of ULXs (in prep).


XSPEC model ulxlc: http://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/~dauser/research/ulxlc/


STARTRACK FILES
===============
Raw data files from STRARTRACK are found in data/external/data_mdot
File name guide:
    eg: 'Z_0.002_tage_20.dat'
    'Z_0.002' = Metallicity
    'tage_20' = Age of system (time since ZAMS in Myr).

COLUMN NAMES:
mdot:
    mass transfer rate (in solar masses per Myr; to the disk, not to the accretor, 
    which is lower due to the mass loss in disk wind),
m:
    mass of a compact object (in solar masses; we assumed that these with a mass 
    lower than 2.5 Msun are NSs, whereas the heavier ones are BHs).
idum, iidd:
    identificators of the system in the simulations. They have no physical meaning,
    but will allow to find more info about some potentially odd, or interesting system.
Z:
    Metallicity | range: 0.0002 - 0.02 
tage:
    Age of system (time since ZAMS in Myr). | range: 10 - 10000



ulxlc_code_v0.1/Batch.py
========================
This script is used to automate running the ulxlc XSPEC model
http://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/~dauser/research/ulxlc/
and save the plotted lightcurves to text files.

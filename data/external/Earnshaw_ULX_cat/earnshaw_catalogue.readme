Column descriptions for the catalogue of ultraluminous X-ray source candidates presented in Earnshaw+ (2018):


Column		Unit		Description
1-318		-		As in 3XMM-DR4 (Rosen+ 2015)
319-384		-		As in RC3 (de Vaucouleurs+ 1991), with values from CNG (Karachentsev+ 2004) inserted into corresponding columns
385-392 	- 		Galaxy properties from NED, including DISTANCE_NED calculated from the VELOCITY_NED using H0 = 75 km/s
393-402		-		Galaxy properties from NBG (Tully & Fisher 1988)
403		Mpc		The distance to the galaxy as an average of NED Distance Database (NED-D) entries using the best method (below)
404		Mpc		The 1-sigma uncertainty on the NED-D distance
405		- 		The method of distance estimation used to calculate the NED-D distance (first available of Cepheids, TRGB, SN1a and T-F)
406		- 		The number of entries using the above method averaged to produce the NED-D distance
407-408		Mpc		The best distance to the galaxy and its source (first available of NED-D, NBG, NED, RC3/CNG)
409		mag		The absolute BT magnitude of the host galaxy, calculated from BT_MAG_CORR and DISTANCE_BEST
410		arcsec		The angular separation between the detection position and the NED galaxy position
411		arcsec		The minimum separation, defined as the angular separation minus three times the detection position uncertainty
412-414		erg/s		The full-band (0.2-12.0 keV) luminosity, uncertainty and sum of the two, calculated from EP_8_FLUX(_ERR) and DISTANCE_BEST
415-420		-		Flags indicating whether the source is present in six previous ULX catalogues
421-423		-		Flags indicating whether the source is located in a galaxy complete to 10^38, 10^39 and 10^40 erg/s
